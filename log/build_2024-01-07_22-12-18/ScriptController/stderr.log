[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrslcpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "rslcpp", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rslcpp" with any
  of the following names:

    rslcppConfig.cmake
    rslcpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rslcpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rslcpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "rslcpp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
